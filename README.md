## ❗ Problem Statement
Students in college frequently lose personal belongings like ID cards, keys, wallets, notebooks, earphones, chargers and mobile accessories.  
Recovery usually depends on WhatsApp groups, security office boards or word of mouth. These methods are unorganized and many items never reach their rightful owner.

There is no centralized digital system inside the campus to report and find lost items efficiently.

## 💡 Our Solution
Campus Recovery Portal (FindIt) is a centralized web platform where students can report lost items and found items.  
The system directly connects the person who lost the item with the person who found it.

Users login using Email OTP verification to prevent fake posts and spam entries.
